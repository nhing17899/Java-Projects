### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## Nice to meet you guys on my GitHub

Currently, I am a Student at VNUK Institute of Research and Executive Education in Danang City in Vietnam.
I am major in Data Science. However, coding is one of my interests as it is absolutely inspiring that stimulates me to think logically and critically to solve the problems.
Cannot say that Data Scientist should focus more on Math and Statistics, which stems from the truth that coding is logic and coding is tool boosting myself to nonstop using my "brain" that is also the requirement of a Data Scientist.

Best regard,
